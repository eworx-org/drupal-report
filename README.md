# Drupal fixes and changes Report

> How to estimate the costs and time needed to fix issues or make changes to a Drupal website that you did not develop!
> Before giving a proposal you need to inspect the site! But inspecting a Drupal site is not as simple as you believe...
> Here is a **basic checklist** of the Report that you need to deliver before doing anything on the site.

### Before the Report needs
- Drupal admin credentials (user 1)
- Hosting credentials (see server/system details, tools installed etc)
- Other services credentials (eg CDN, SSL provider, Google Analytics etc)
- A brief of the project scope
- What happened with the previous Developer/Company (and there is no collaboration anymore)
- Why the site needs the changes

### Common Reports
- Site performance (use well known services such as [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights))
- SEO
- Mobile UX and design
- Drupal content Structure (Content types, taxonomy etc)
- Usage of special modules (eg Panels)
- Drupal best practices
- Theming
- Modules that should not be used
- Modules that should be used
- (Security) Updates
- Views best practices
- Menus and navigation
- Blocks
- Multilingual behavior

### What to deliver
- A **pdf** of the report (use Google Docs to create the official report)
- Include images/screenshots when needed to explain the text
- **Propose changes** with details for every aspect that need to change
- **Include prices and timesheet** for every change
- An **invoice of $150 - $500 charge** (this price depends on the size of the site and the working hours were spent)

### My thoughts
- Avoid giving an estimate/proposal before making a site Report
- Don not try to start the Report before getting the credentials
- Tell your customer that this Report is like a Doctor diagnosis and that it can be used for future tasks
- Do not forget to include costs such as for copying the site/db, creating a dev environment, uploading changes to live environment (eg usage of features module) etc
- After the Report, avoid touching projects that are not well structured and do not follow (Drupal) best practices
- Avoid expressing negative for other Companies/Developers (talk about the site and not about the people that were involved)
- Such projects are good to "learn" new things and other people practices (educational projects)
