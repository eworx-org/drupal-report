# Drupal fixes and changes Report

> How to estimate the costs and time needed to fix issues or make changes to a Drupal website that you did not develop!
> Before giving a proposal you need to inspect the site! But inspecting a Drupal site is not as simple as you believe...
> Here is a **basic checklist** of the Report that you need to deliver before doing anything on the site.

### Before the Report needs
- **Technical specification document** (if exists).
- **Drupal admin credentials** (user 1, or Admin role account). This is needed to check the existing structure, functionality, modules etc. Normally there whould be a dev subdomain to log in. If not credentials and demo provided ask for the git code and a dumb database to install the project locally.
- A **brief of the project scope**.
- What are the **project goals** (eg register new members)? How do they measure them? Do they currently meet the goals?
- What happened with the previous Developer/Company (and there is no collaboration anymore)?
- **Why the site needs the changes** (fixes, update, upgrate, migration etc)?
- Will there be a **new Skin** (or theme, template whatever they call it)?
- What are the **things that do not work well** now and they would like to improve?
- How many **different Authors** are currently adding content?
- How many **different User Roles** exist (eg Anonymous, Member, Pro Member etc)? Which are each Role permissions on the project? Can we simplify any process for the users?
- **How many Drupal nodes** (you can name it as "pages") are currently on the database?
- Will we need a **data migration**? If so, are there any content entry fields we need to remove or any new we need to add?
- Are there any (high) **payments to 3rd party services** that we can avoid? Eg a CDN.
- Who is going to **support the project** technically (Drupal updates, security issues, technical support)? Remember to provide a yearly Support subscription with specific tasks on the contract.
- **Where is the project hosted** now? What are the needs for Database, PHP etc? Are there any special software used? Offer to move to a new hosting provider if current does not fit us. For big customers offer Drupal cloud based solutions (Acquia, Pantheon etc).

Other (not so important)
- Hosting credentials (to check server/system details, tools installed etc that are special for the project to work).
- Other services credentials (eg CDN, SSL provider, Google Analytics etc) that are used.

### Common Reports
- Site performance (use well known services such as [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights), [gtmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com) and [yellowlab.tools](https://yellowlab.tools))
- SEO (Does the project follow the basic SEO rules?)
- Mobile UX and design (does it work well on small screens?)
- Heatmap reports (eg using tools like [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com)).

### Drupal specific Reports
- Drupal content Structure (Content types, taxonomy etc)
- Usage of special modules (eg Panels)
- Drupal best practices
- Theming
- Modules that should not be used
- Modules that should be used
- (Security) Updates
- Views best practices
- Menus and navigation
- Blocks
- Multilingual behavior

### What to deliver
- A **pdf** of the report (use Google Docs to create the official report)
- Include images/screenshots when needed to explain the text
- **Propose changes** with details for every aspect that need to change
- **Include prices and timesheet** for every change
- An **invoice of $150 - $500 charge** (this price depends on the size of the site and the working hours were spent)

### My thoughts
- Avoid giving an estimate/proposal before making a site Report.
- Do not start the Report before getting the credentials or a demo.
- Tell your customer that this Report is like a Doctor diagnosis and that it can be used for future tasks.
- Do not forget to include costs such as for copying the site/db, creating a dev environment, uploading changes to live environment (eg usage of features module) etc.
- After the Report, avoid touching projects that are not well structured and do not follow (Drupal) best practices!
- Avoid expressing negative for other Companies/Developers (talk about the site and not about the people that were involved).
- Such projects are good to "learn" new things and other people practices (educational projects).
